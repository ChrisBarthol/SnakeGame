Greetings Ceros code reviewer person!

If you're Brian again, hello!

If you're not, it's great to meet you.

This repo is a quick (admittedly thrown together) Snake game as requested in the document Brian sent me.  He suggested that time was of the essence so not all of the 'Coulds' have been completed.  It does however work in fullscreen, make use of jQuery (where appropriate), and tick all of the 'Must' and 'Should' boxes.

I hope to hear from you soon,

Mike
